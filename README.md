I have built a script for assigning open incidents with the help of pysnow, a library for interfacing with the ServiceNow REST API.

It's easy to use, well documented.

Compatible with python 2 and 3.

Installing is simple:

# pip install pysnow
You'll find documentation and more info on Github: https://github.com/rbw/pysnow
